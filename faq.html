<p>
  Currently we are at the very initial phase of finding a model on which to establish the institute.
  We are also eager to work together with other passionate researchers/professors in the field of informatics, applied mathematics, physics and in any one of our thematic areas who share our dreams.
  Our major goals are:<br><br>
  1. Conducting world class research in Nepal and also have a strong collaboration with excellent international educational and research institutes. <br>
  2. Working together with other institutes and universities to invigorate the scientific and academic community of Nepal to transform higher education and research situation.<br>  
  3. Playing an important role in the transformation mentioned above to produce highly competent researchers, academicians, thinkers and leaders of the 21st century.<br><br>

  We don't know when exactly this institute will be opened.
  Currently we are at the drawing board trying to find answers of some important "how" questions.
  We are also trying to find other like-minded people to build a strong team.
  The current preparation phase is reflected by the state of this website.
  <br><br>
  We want to establish as soon as possible and it could be for instance in 2017. 
  We will establish the institute once we have a clear idea of its funding model, have minimum number of researchers, and a working model that we believe is good enough to conduct a world class research activities in Nepal.
  But the latest deadline before which we will definitely start is 2021.
